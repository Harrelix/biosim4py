# biosim4py
Python implementation of davidmiller's biosim4: https://github.com/davidrmiller/biosim4  
Original video explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk  
After watching the video on youtube, I wanted to play around with it, but I don't know C++, so I re-created it in python. There're some features not yet implemented like signals and killing.
# Requires
Python 3.10  
Libraries: pillow, opencv-python, numpy, bitstring
